## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that helps manage changes to files, code, documents, or any set of information over time. It tracks every modification to a project in a special kind of database.
Why GitHub is a Popular Tool for Version Control:
    Integration with Git:
        GitHub seamlessly integrates with Git, the most widely used version control system, allowing developers to manage their code versions, track changes, and collaborate           with others efficiently.
    Collaboration:
        GitHub offers tools like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking, which facilitate collaboration among developers. Multiple developers can work on the same             project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work.
        It provides a platform where developers can contribute to projects from anywhere in the world, making it crucial for open-source development.
    Hosting and Sharing:
        GitHub hosts repositories in the cloud, making it easy to share code with others, either publicly or privately. This centralization is key for teams working remotely           or across different locations.
        GitHub Pages also allow developers to host static websites directly from their repositories.
    Community and Ecosystem:
        GitHub has a vast community of developers, making it a hub for open-source projects. Developers can fork, contribute to, and collaborate on projects easily.
        It also integrates with a wide range of tools and services, including continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, project management tools, and            more.
    Documentation and Wiki:
        GitHub repositories can include documentation and wikis, making it easier to document the codebase and share information with team members and contributors.

How Version Control Helps in Maintaining Project Integrity
History and Audit Trail:
        Version control keeps a detailed history of all changes made to a project, including who made the changes and why. This history is invaluable for auditing,                     troubleshooting, and understanding the evolution of the project.
Backup and Recovery:
        With version control, every change is recorded, so if something goes wrong, it’s easy to revert to a previous state. This protects against data loss and errors. Parallel Development:
        Developers can work on different features or fixes in parallel without interfering with each other’s work. Branching and merging allow these parallel efforts to be              integrated smoothly into the main project.
Conflict Resolution:
        When changes from different branches conflict, version control provides tools to resolve these conflicts, ensuring that the final codebase is consistent and                    functional.
Collaboration and Coordination:
        Version control facilitates collaboration among team members by allowing them to work on separate branches and merge changes systematically. It also supports code              reviews and discussions, helping maintain code quality.
Transparency and Accountability:
        Every change made to the codebase is tracked, making it clear who made what changes and when. This transparency fosters accountability and helps in understanding               decisions made throughout the project.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Setting up a new repository on GitHub is a straightforward process, but it involves some important decisions that can affect how you manage and collaborate on your project. Here’s a step-by-step guide along with key considerations:
1. Sign In to GitHub
     First, log in to your GitHub account at GitHub.com. If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create one.
2. Create a New Repository
    Click on the + icon in the top-right corner of the GitHub homepage.
    Select New repository from the dropdown menu.
3. Repository Details
    Repository Name: Choose a unique name for your repository. The name should be descriptive and relevant to the project.
    Description (optional): Add a brief description of what your repository is about. This helps others understand the purpose of the project.
4. Choose Visibility
    Public: Your repository will be visible to everyone on GitHub. Anyone can view and clone the repository, but only you (or collaborators you add) can push changes.
    Private: The repository will be visible only to you and the collaborators you specify. This is useful for projects that aren’t ready for public release or for proprietary     code.
5. Create the Repository
    After filling in the details, click the Create repository button. Your new repository will be created, and you’ll be redirected to its page.
Important Decisions to Make During Setup:
    1.Repository Name: Choose a meaningful and descriptive name that reflects the project’s purpose.
    2.Visibility (Public vs. Private): Decide if the repository should be public or private based on who needs access to the code.
    3.License: Consider what level of openness you want for your project and choose an appropriate license. This decision affects how others can use your code.
    4.Initial Files: Deciding to include a README, .gitignore, and a license at the beginning can save time and establish best practices early in the project.
    5.Branching Model: Decide if you want to use a specific branching model (e.g., GitFlow) from the start, especially for larger or collaborative projects.
     
## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
Importance of the README File in a GitHub Repository

The README file is one of the most important files in a GitHub repository. It serves as the first point of contact for anyone who visits your repository, providing them with essential information about the project. A well-written README can significantly enhance the usability, accessibility, and collaboration on a project.
Why the README File is Important:
    First Impressions:
        The README file is typically the first thing users see when they visit a repository. It sets the tone for the project and helps users quickly understand what the              project is about, how to use it, and how to contribute.
    Project Overview:
        It provides a high-level overview of the project, including its purpose, features, and status. This helps potential users or contributors decide if the project is            relevant to their needs or interests.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
Public vs. Private Repositories on GitHub

Public and private repositories on GitHub serve different purposes and offer distinct advantages and disadvantages, particularly when it comes to collaborative projects. 
Public Repository:
    A public repository is accessible to anyone on the internet. Anyone can view, fork, clone, and contribute to the repository (through pull requests), but only the              repository owner and collaborators can push changes directly.
Advantages:
    Visibility and Collaboration:
        Open Source Contributions: Public repositories are ideal for open-source projects where you want to encourage contributions from a broad community.
        Attracting Talent: Being public allows developers from around the world to discover your project, contribute, and collaborate, potentially leading to more diverse            and innovative solutions.
        Showcasing Work: Public repositories can be used to showcase your work to potential employers or collaborators, serving as a portfolio of your projects.
Disadvantages:
    Security Risks:
        Exposure: Since the code is accessible to everyone, sensitive information (like API keys or proprietary algorithms) must be carefully managed to avoid leaks.
        Malicious Use: Public code can be copied or misused by others, including in ways that may not align with the original intentions of the developers.
    Competition:
        In competitive industries, making your code public could reveal your strategies or innovations to competitors.
    Maintenance:
        Public repositories may attract contributions that require more oversight and review, potentially increasing the maintenance burden.
Private Repository:
    A private repository is restricted to selected individuals or teams. Only invited collaborators can view, fork, or clone the repository. The general public cannot see         the repository or its contents.
Advantages:
    Control and Privacy:
        Confidentiality: Private repositories keep your work confidential, making them ideal for proprietary projects, internal tools, or sensitive information.
        Selective Access: You have full control over who can access the repository, which is crucial for protecting intellectual property and managing collaboration in a             controlled environment.
    Security:
        Protected Development: Private repositories help prevent unauthorized access, reducing the risk of leaks and unauthorized use of your code. This is particularly               important for commercial products, private research, or projects under development.
    Collaboration in Closed Teams:
        Focused Collaboration: In private repositories, collaboration is limited to a select group, making it easier to manage contributions and maintain consistent quality           without outside interference.
    Compliance:
        Some organizations require strict access controls and privacy for compliance with legal or regulatory standards. Private repositories help meet these requirements.
Disadvantages:
    Limited Collaboration:
        Reduced Contributions: Because the repository is private, you miss out on potential contributions from the broader community. This can slow down the development              process and reduce the diversity of ideas.
        Visibility: The project isn’t visible to the public, which means it won’t attract unsolicited contributors, testers, or supporters from the community.
    Cost:
        Paid Plans: While GitHub offers free private repositories, advanced features or larger team-based private repositories may require a paid plan. This could be a                consideration for budget-conscious teams or individuals.
    Reduced Exposure:
        Limited Portfolio Use: If you want to use your projects to demonstrate your skills or attract collaborators, a private repository won’t help with that unless you              make it public later.

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
Commits in Git are snapshots of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit records changes made to the files in your repository, along with metadata such as the author of the changes, the date, and a message describing what was done. Commits allow you to track the history of your project, revert to previous states, and manage different versions effectively.
 Steps involved in making first commit to a GitHub repository:
    1.Stage Changes: Use git add to stage files that you want to include in a commit.
    2.Create a Commit: Use git commit -m "commit message" to save a snapshot of the staged changes.
    3.Push to Remote: Use git push to upload your commits to a GitHub repository.
How Commits Help in Tracking Changes and Managing Versions:
    Change Tracking:
        Each commit logs specific changes made to the code, allowing you to see what was modified, added, or deleted. This is crucial for understanding the evolution of your         project.
    Version Management:
        By committing regularly, you create a series of checkpoints that you can return to if something goes wrong. This enables you to experiment with new features or                 changes without risking the integrity of the project.
    Collaboration:
        In collaborative projects, commits allow team members to track who made what changes and when. This makes it easier to coordinate efforts and resolve conflicts.
    Documentation:
        Each commit includes a message describing the changes. Over time, these messages form a log that documents the development process, which is useful for both current          team members and future contributors.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branching in Git is a powerful feature that allows developers to diverge from the main line of development and work on changes in isolation. Each branch represents an independent line of development, enabling multiple features, bug fixes, or experiments to be worked on simultaneously without affecting the main project.
Importance of Branching in Collaborative Development
    Isolated Development:
        Developers can work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without disturbing the stable codebase in the main branch. This isolation prevents incomplete or buggy         code from affecting the project.
    Parallel Workflows:
        Multiple team members can work on different branches at the same time, allowing for parallel development. This improves productivity and reduces bottlenecks in the           development process.
    Safe Experimentation:
        Branches allow developers to try out new ideas or changes without the risk of breaking the main project. If the experiment fails, the branch can be deleted without           affecting the main codebase.
    Controlled Integration:
        Changes from different branches can be reviewed and tested independently before being merged into the main branch. This ensures that only well-tested and approved            changes are integrated, maintaining code quality.
    Versioning and Releases:
        Branching supports versioning and release management. For example, a branch can be created for each release, allowing for patches and updates to be applied to                specific versions of the software.       
Process of Creating, Using, and Merging Branches in a Typical Git Workflow
Branching is a fundamental aspect of working with Git, allowing developers to work on different tasks in parallel without interfering with the main codebase. Here’s how you can create, use, and merge branches in a typical workflow:
1. Creating a Branch
  Step 1: Switch to the Base Branch
    Before creating a new branch, switch to the branch from which you want to create the new branch, typically the main or master branch.
  Step 2: Create and Switch to the New Branch
    Create a new branch and switch to it using the git checkout -b command. The new branch will be based on the current branch.   
2. Using the Branch
  Step 3: Make Changes
    Now that you're on the new branch, you can make changes to the code. These changes will only affect this branch and not the main branch.
  Step 4: Stage and Commit Changes
    After making changes, stage the files you want to commit.
    Then, commit the changes with a meaningful message.
  Step 5: Push the Branch to GitHub
    To share your branch with others or back it up, push it to GitHub.
3. Merging the Branch
  Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)
    On GitHub, go to your repository and create a Pull Request (PR) from feature-branch to main. This allows others to review your code, run tests, and discuss the changes.
  Step 7: Review and Approve the PR
    Collaborators can review the PR, suggest changes, and approve it. Once everyone is satisfied, the PR can be merged into the main branch.
  Step 8: Merge the Branch
    After the PR is approved, you can merge the branch.
        If you're working in GitHub, you can use the "Merge Pull Request" button.
        Alternatively, from the command line.
  Step 9: Resolve Conflicts (if any)
    If there are merge conflicts, Git will alert you. You must manually resolve these conflicts by editing the conflicting files. After resolving conflicts.
  Step 10: Delete the Merged Branch 
    Once the branch has been merged, you may delete it to keep the repository clean.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
The Role of Pull Requests in the GitHub Workflow
Pull Requests (PRs) are a central feature of the GitHub workflow, enabling developers to collaborate on projects, review code, and manage contributions efficiently. A pull request allows a developer to propose changes to a repository, facilitating discussion, review, and eventual merging of those changes into the main codebase.
How Pull Requests Facilitate Code Review and Collaboration
    Code Review:
        Pull requests allow team members to review the code before it is merged into the main branch. Reviewers can provide feedback, suggest improvements, and ensure that            the code adheres to the project's standards and best practices.
        GitHub provides tools to comment on specific lines of code, request changes, and approve or reject the pull request. This process ensures that the code is thoroughly          vetted before it becomes part of the main project.
    Collaboration:
        PRs enable multiple developers to collaborate on a feature or fix. Team members can discuss the proposed changes directly within the pull request, making it easier            to coordinate efforts and reach consensus.
        The PR serves as a record of the conversation and decision-making process, which is valuable for future reference.
Typical Steps Involved in Creating and Merging a Pull Request
Step 1: Create a Branch
    Before making changes, create a new branch in your local repository. This branch should be based on the main branch (e.g., main or master)
    Make your changes on this branch and commit them.
Step 2: Push the Branch to GitHub
    Once you’ve committed your changes, push the branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
    This makes the branch available on GitHub and allows you to create a pull request.
Step 3: Create a Pull Request
    On GitHub, navigate to the repository and find the "Compare & pull request" button that appears after pushing your branch.
    Alternatively, go to the "Pull Requests" tab and click "New pull request."
    Select the base branch (usually main) and compare it with your feature branch.
    Add a title and description for the pull request, summarizing the changes made and any relevant context or issues being addressed.
Step 4: Review the Pull Request
    Other team members can now review the pull request. Reviewers can:
        Comment on specific lines of code.
        Request changes if something needs to be addressed before merging.
        Approve the pull request if everything looks good.
    The author of the PR can respond to feedback, make additional commits, and push them to the same branch. These commits will automatically be added to the pull request.
Step 5: Address Continuous Integration (CI) Feedback (if applicable)
    If the project uses CI, automated tests and checks will run when the PR is created or updated. If any tests fail, the PR will show the failure, and the author needs to address these issues before merging.
Step 6: Merge the Pull Request
    Once the pull request has been reviewed and approved, and all checks have passed, it’s ready to be merged. There are a few options for merging:
        Merge Commit: Combines the changes with a new commit on the base branch. This preserves the history of the branch.
        Squash and Merge: Combines all commits in the pull request into a single commit on the base branch. This creates a cleaner history.
        Rebase and Merge: Reapplies the commits from the feature branch on top of the base branch, avoiding a merge commit.
    Select the preferred merge method and complete the merge on GitHub.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forking is a crucial feature on GitHub for contributing to projects, experimenting with new ideas, and creating personalized versions of repositories. It allows developers to work independently on a copy of a repository while providing a mechanism to propose changes and collaborate with others through pull requests. Cloning, on the other hand, is used for local development on any repository, whether it’s a fork or the original. Understanding both concepts helps streamline the development process and enhance collaboration.
How Forking Differs from Cloning
    Forking:
        Purpose: Creates a copy of a repository under your own GitHub account. This copy is fully independent of the original repository.
        Location: The forked repository resides on GitHub under your account.
        Use Case: Used for contributing to a project you do not have direct access to or for making substantial changes without affecting the original project.
        Example: You might fork an open-source project to propose new features or fix bugs.
    Cloning:
        Purpose: Creates a local copy of a repository on your computer. This local copy is a direct mirror of the repository and allows you to work with the files on your                     own machine.
        Location: The cloned repository is on your local filesystem.
        Use Case: Used to work on a repository locally, whether it’s your own or one that you have access to.
        Example: You might clone a repository to make local changes, test new features, or debug issues.
Scenarios Where Forking Is Particularly Useful
    Contributing to Open Source Projects:
        Scenario: You want to contribute to an open-source project but do not have write access to the original repository.
        How Forking Helps: By forking the repository, you can make changes in your own copy. You can then create a pull request to propose these changes to the original               repository. This workflow is commonly used in open-source communities.
    Experimenting with Changes:
        Scenario: You want to experiment with new features or significant changes in a project without affecting the original codebase.
        How Forking Helps: Forking allows you to freely make changes in your own version of the repository. If your experiments work out, you can submit a pull request. If            not, the original repository remains unaffected.
    Creating a Personal Version:
        Scenario: You need a personalized version of a project that diverges from the original repository.
        How Forking Helps: Forking gives you a separate copy where you can apply customizations and modifications specific to your needs. This is useful for creating a                derivative project that builds on top of an existing one.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.
Importance of Issues and Project Boards on GitHub
Issues and Project Boards are integral tools on GitHub that enhance project organization, task management, and collaborative development. They provide structured ways to track bugs, manage tasks, and keep teams organized.
GitHub Issues
Issues are a way to track tasks, enhancements, bugs, and other project-related activities. They allow for detailed discussion, tracking, and management of work items within a repository.
Key Features and Benefits:
    Tracking Bugs and Feature Requests:
        Purpose: Issues are commonly used to report bugs, request new features, and track tasks. Each issue can include a detailed description, steps to reproduce (for                   bugs), and additional context.
        Example: A user encounters a bug in a web application where the login button doesn’t work. They create an issue describing the problem, including screenshots and               steps to reproduce.
    Organizing Work:
        Purpose: Issues can be categorized with labels (e.g., "bug", "enhancement", "help wanted"), assigned to specific team members, and tracked for progress.
        Example: A repository might have labels like "high priority", "low priority", and "documentation" to help prioritize and categorize tasks.
    Discussion and Collaboration:
        Purpose: Team members can comment on issues to discuss solutions, provide feedback, and offer additional information. This facilitates collaborative problem-solving          and decision-making.
        Example: A developer comments on an issue to provide a potential fix, and the team discusses whether it’s a viable solution.
    Linking to Commits and Pull Requests:
        Purpose: Issues can be referenced in commit messages and pull requests, providing traceability between the work done and the issue being addressed.
        Example: A pull request might include a message like "Fixes #42" to indicate that it resolves issue #42, automatically linking the commit to the issue.
GitHub Project Boards
Project Boards are Kanban-style boards that help organize and visualize the progress of work items within a repository. They provide a structured way to manage tasks and track the status of different activities.
Key Features and Benefits:
    Organizing Tasks:
        Purpose: Project boards allow you to create columns (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done") and move tasks (represented by issues or pull requests) through these                stages.
        Example: A project board might have columns for "Backlog", "Sprint 1", "In Review", and "Completed" to reflect different stages of development.
    Tracking Progress:
        Purpose: By moving issues and pull requests across columns, you can visually track the progress of tasks and overall project status.
        Example: Moving an issue from "To Do" to "In Progress" and finally to "Done" provides a clear visual representation of its progress.
    Managing Sprints and Milestones:
        Purpose: Project boards can be used to organize work into sprints or milestones, helping teams manage and prioritize tasks within specific timeframes.
        Example: A board might be set up for a specific sprint, with columns representing different tasks to be completed during that sprint.
    Improving Visibility and Coordination:
        Purpose: Project boards provide an overview of all ongoing work, helping team members understand what needs to be done, who is working on what, and what the current          status is.
        Example: A team can use a project board to coordinate work between developers, designers, and project managers, ensuring that everyone is aligned on priorities and           deadlines.
Examples of How Issues and Project Boards Enhance Collaboration
    Bug Tracking and Resolution:
        Scenario: A team is working on a web application and uses issues to track and report bugs. Each bug report includes detailed information, and team members assign              themselves to fix the bugs.
        Project Board: The bugs are added to the project board under the "Bug Fixes" column. As developers work on fixes, they move the issues through columns like "In                Progress" and "In Review" until they are resolved.
    Feature Development:
        Scenario: A new feature is planned for the application. An issue is created to describe the feature requirements. The issue is then added to the project board under            a column like "Feature Development".
        Project Board: The feature’s progress is tracked by moving the issue through columns as it progresses from "Design" to "Development" and finally to "Testing". This             helps the team see the status of the feature at a glance.
    Project Planning and Management:
        Scenario: A project manager sets up a project board to organize tasks for an upcoming release. Tasks are broken down into issues and assigned to different team                members.
        Project Board: The project board is organized into columns for different stages of the release, such as "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", and "Completed". This                 provides transparency and helps ensure that all tasks are completed on time.
    Team Coordination:
        Scenario: A team is working on multiple aspects of a project simultaneously, including bug fixes, feature development, and documentation.
        Project Board: Different columns on the board are used to track the status of tasks in each area. Team members can easily see what tasks are in progress, who is               working on what, and what still needs to be done.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
Using GitHub for version control offers numerous benefits, but it also comes with challenges, especially for new users. Understanding these common pitfalls and best practices can help ensure smooth collaboration and effective use of GitHub.
Common Challenges
    Understanding Git Concepts:
        Pitfall: New users might struggle with basic Git concepts such as branching, merging, and rebasing.
        Strategy: Take time to learn foundational Git concepts through tutorials and practice. Use resources like the Pro Git book and GitHub’s own documentation. Practice            using Git in a sandbox environment to build confidence.
    Handling Merge Conflicts:
        Pitfall: Merge conflicts can occur when multiple branches make conflicting changes to the same lines of code.
        Strategy: Regularly pull updates from the main branch to keep your branch in sync and minimize conflicts. When conflicts arise, use Git’s conflict resolution tools            or editors like VS Code or GitKraken to help resolve them.
    Managing Large Repositories:
        Pitfall: Large repositories or files can lead to performance issues and slow cloning or pushing.
        Strategy: Avoid committing large files directly into the repository. Use Git Large File Storage (LFS) for large files and ensure that the repository only includes             necessary files. Keep the repository clean by regularly reviewing and removing unnecessary files.
    Effective Branching and Merging:
        Pitfall: Poor branching strategies or improper merging can lead to chaotic project histories and difficult-to-track changes.
        Strategy: Adopt a clear branching strategy such as Git Flow or GitHub Flow. Create branches for specific features or fixes and ensure that they are regularly merged           into the main branch. Use pull requests to review and discuss changes before merging.
    Commit Messages and Documentation:
        Pitfall: Inconsistent or unclear commit messages can make it difficult to understand the project history.
        Strategy: Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of each change. Follow a consistent format for commit messages (e.g., using prefixes like          “fix” or “add”) to improve readability and maintainability.
    Ignoring Git Best Practices:
        Pitfall: Skipping best practices such as regular commits or failing to pull changes before starting new work.
        Strategy: Commit changes frequently to capture progress and provide detailed commit messages. Pull updates from the main branch regularly to stay current with                changes and avoid working on outdated code.
Best Practices for Using GitHub
    Use Branches for Features and Fixes:
        Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. This isolates your work from the main branch and allows for easier management of changes.
        Example: Use branches named after features or issues, such as feature/new-login-page or bugfix/fix-typo.
    Create and Review Pull Requests:
        Use pull requests (PRs) to propose changes and facilitate code reviews. PRs provide a platform for discussion, feedback, and approval before changes are merged.
        Example: Before merging a feature branch, open a pull request to review code changes, discuss improvements, and run automated tests.
    Write Clear Commit Messages:
        Write meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made. A good commit message helps others understand the context and purpose of the changes.
        Example: Use messages like “Fix bug causing application crash on login” rather than vague descriptions like “Fixed stuff”.
    Keep Your Fork Updated:
        If you’re working with a forked repository, regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository to stay updated with the latest changes.
        Example: Use commands like git fetch upstream and git merge upstream/main to keep your fork in sync.
    Utilize Issues and Project Boards:
        Track tasks, bugs, and features using GitHub Issues and organize work with Project Boards. This helps in managing project progress and ensuring that nothing falls             through the cracks.
        Example: Create issues for new features and bugs, and use project boards to track the status of tasks from “To Do” to “Done”.
    Leverage GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
        Automate testing and deployment processes using GitHub Actions. This helps in catching issues early and ensuring that code changes meet quality standards.
        Example: Set up workflows to run tests on every push to the repository or automatically deploy code to a staging environment.
    Use GitHub’s Collaboration Features:
        Take advantage of GitHub’s features for collaboration, such as mentions (@username) in comments, assigning issues to team members, and using labels to categorize               work.
        Example: Use labels like “urgent” or “enhancement” to prioritize issues and assign them to team members to ensure that work is distributed effectively.
